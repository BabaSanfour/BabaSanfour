I am a 2nd-year Graduate Student at Université de Montréal, Québec, Canada 🇨🇦, pursuing a Masters in Computer Science, who is passionate about Artificial Intelligence 🤖, Neuroscience 🧠,  Python programming 🐍, and open source :octocat:. I love to learn and contribute in any and every possible way. It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. I'am eager to make all my projects open source and reproducible. I also have a Telecommunication engineering and mathematics background from my studies in Tunisia 🇹🇳. I am also involved in a lot of *organizational works* in university related to clubs, hackathons, fests and workshops and helped in building many communities from scratch ⚡ .

You can ask me anything (within reason). I am looking forward to absorb knowledge 🧠, gain experience 🏭, collaborate 🤝 and work on amazing projects 🏭 for the benefit of the world 🌍!
